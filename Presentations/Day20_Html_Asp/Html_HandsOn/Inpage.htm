   <h1>What CSS Stands for</h1>
   <p>
   The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by B. R. Ambedkar, on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign, democratic, republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India. The three words 'socialist','secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976
   </p>
   <p id="p1">
      India held its first national elections under the Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60% was recorded. The National Congress Party won an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as Prime Minister. President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India.
