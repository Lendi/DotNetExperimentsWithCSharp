   and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the <b><q>Indian
   Institutes of Technology</q></b> were founded across the nation. Nehru advocated a socialist model for

   workers, and the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel, aviation, shipping,
   electricity and mining. Village common lands were seized and an extensive public works and
   industrialisation campaign resulted in the construction of major dams, irrigation canals, roads,
   thermal and hydroelectric power stations.</p>
